[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com)

Init: ***Apr 5, 2020***

This is my second attempt to create a sort of lite version of Instagram on my own only for study purpose - 
this is a non-profitable application.
##
#### Stack:
* **Client**: React + ***MobX*** (no Redux this time), MD Bootstrap, SASS, webpack...
* **Server**: Node.JS + ***Hapi.JS***, MongoDB + Mongoose, ***GraphQL***, Docker...

##
#### In this project I am planing to perform the following features:
* Main user page with his/her followers & followings posts
* Gallery page with posts of random users
* User's settings page - update metadata
* Liking and posting
* Uploading new pictures
* others

##
