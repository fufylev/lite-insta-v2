## Lite Insta V2

This is my second attempt to create a sort of lite version of Instagram on my own only for study purpose - 
this is a non-profitable application.

##
#### In this project I am planing to perform the following features:
* Main user page with his/her followers & followings posts
* Gallery page with post of random users
* User's settings page - update metadata
* Liking and posting
* Uploading new pictures
* others

##
#### Stack:
* Client: React + MobX (no Redux this time), MD Bootstrap, SASS, webpack...
* Server: Node.JS + Hapi.JS, MongoDB + Mongoose, GraphQL, Docker...

## 
### Install:
Clone this [repository](https://github.com/fufylev/lite-insta-v2)

Run this in terminal:\
`cd lite-insta-v2`\

Go to file `./server/.env`  and apply/change your DB setting

then:\
`yarn start` or `npm start`
