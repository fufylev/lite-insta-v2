## Lite Insta V2 (*TypeScript*)

Init: ***Apr 5, 2020***

This is my second attempt to create a sort of lite version of Instagram on my own only for study purpose - 
this is a non-profitable application.

*Feature: Apr 8, 2020 - decided to rewrite project on the TypeScript*

##
#### Stack:
* **Client**: React (hooks only), *TypeScript (custom hooks)*, Materialize CSS, SASS
* **Server**: Node.JS, MongoDB + Mongoose, *GraphQL*, Docker...

##
#### In this project I am planing to perform the following features:
* Authentication, register, login with Facebook âœ…
* Main user page with his/her followers & followings posts
* Gallery page with posts of random users
* User's settings page - update metadata
* Liking and posting
* Uploading new pictures
* others

##
