## Lite Insta V2

Init: ***Apr 5, 2020***

***New: Apr 8, 2020 - decided to rewrite project on the TypeScript***

This is my second attempt to create a sort of lite version of Instagram on my own only for study purpose - 
this is a non-profitable application.
##
#### Stack:
* **Client**: ***TypeScript***, React + ***MobX*** (no Redux this time), MD Bootstrap, SASS
* **Server**: Node.JS, MongoDB + Mongoose, ***GraphQL***, Docker...

##
#### In this project I am planing to perform the following features:
* Main user page with his/her followers & followings posts
* Gallery page with posts of random users
* User's settings page - update metadata
* Liking and posting
* Uploading new pictures
* others

##
